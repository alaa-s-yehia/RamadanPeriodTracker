# Period Tracker App

## For Muslim Women

There are several period tracker apps out there 
but none target Muslim Women.This app is *necessary* 
because during the Holy Month of Ramadan, women cannot
fast and must make them up at a later date. With this app 
women can input when they get their period;if it's in the 
month of Ramadan it will make sure to track the number of days 
she has missed.

My target audience for this app is **Muslim Women**. It will be 
of use  to her even in months outside of Ramadan as it keeps 
track of her period and ensures it is occurring regularly. 
This project is of interest to me for many reasons :
- Muslim Women's health is often neglected in our communities
- Periods are an indicator of many aspects that involve our health
- Making up our fasts is a common thing, the process should be made easier
- I want to be able to  create something that I can use and benefit from
